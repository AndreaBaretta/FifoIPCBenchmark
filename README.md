# FifoIPCLatency

<!-- [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg?style=flat-square)](http://goldsborough.mit-license.org) -->

A test to specifically benchmark the latency of interprocess communication using a shared-memory FIFO object. 

## Installation

To install the project, you can start by cloning the repo and running the cmake configuration bash script in `tools`.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AndreaBaretta/FifoIPCLatency.git
cd FifoIPCLatency
./tools/configure_builds.sh
```

You can now move into either `builds/release` or `builds/debug` and compile the benchmark in either release mode or test mode. Also, make sure that `cmake` is installed.

```shell
cd ../builds/release
cmake --build .
```

You can now run the executable as sudo.

```shell
sudo ./fifo-ipc-latency
```

## Usage

`g++-10` is recommended for compilation, and it the compiler used to obtain the sample data:
```shell
sudo apt-get install g++-10
```

The c++ standard used for compilation is c++20.

Once you have compiled the benchmark as previously described and have the exeutable, it can take several command-line arguments:

* `-n, --numtries arg`: Number of iterations of the test (default: 1000000)
* `-i, --individual-message`: Save latency data on individual messages
* `-d, --data-dir arg`: Directory for gathered data. If used with -i, it will save latency data on individual messages. If not specified, uses present working directory
* `--cores arg`: If not specified, tests all cores communicating with each other. If one value is specified, then that is fixed as the reference core. If two values are specified, only those two cores are tested
* `-b, --buffer-size arg`: Size of the buffer in the shared FIFO in number of messages (default: 8)
* `-m, --message-size arg`: Size of the message sent to FIFO in number of cache lines (default: 1)
* `--no-save`: If used, gathered data is not stored and does not override any previously gathered data. This is largely for development purposes so you don't kill your SSD

##### Note: All of this information is displayed when running the program with `-h` or `--help`.

For example, you can measure the average latency of sending 100,000 messages, each one spanning 3 cache lines, across cores 1 and 18 through the following command:

```shell
sudo ./fifo-ipc-latency -n 100000 -m 3 --cores 1,18
```

Or, if you wish to test the benchmark by measuring the latency of individual messages sent between all cores but you do not wish to overwrite your current csv files, you can run:

```shell
sudo ./fifo-ipc-latency -i --no-save
```

Please note that to make full use of the benchmark, it is recommended to run the executable as sudo, set the CPU governor to 'performance', and disable CPU C-States in your BIOS.

Lastly, to visualize the data, you can move into the `python` folder.

```shell
cd ../../python
```

Here, you will find a python script which generates a heatmap of the average latency. To see this, run:

```shell
python3 heatmap_avg.py <file-path>
```

If you specify a file path, it will use that particular file. Otherwise, by default, it will use the measurements in `/builds/release/data`.

You can also visualize the distribution of the data gathered from saving the latency of individual measurements by using the following python script:

```shell
python3 dist_individual.py <file-path>
```

Once again, you can specify a file path. If you do not, it will look at `builds/release/data/FifoIpcLatency_0_1.csv`.

Pyhton 3 is necessary to run these scripts. Also, please make sure you have the following packages installed:

```shell
pip3 install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
